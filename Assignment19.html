        <h2>Professional Photographer</h2>
        <p class="para1">The idea of colours floating across a sheet of paper forming either familiar shapes or new creations is appealing to the eye. In reality, though it is much more than just the beads of colour. Photography can capture someoneâ€™s heart and soul. Even the simplest photo has a story that tails along with it. It is an escape from the real world; a creation that narrows on one particular subject and carefully details their every move and emotion.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>If you wanted a pro photographer you are at the right place.</h2>
        <p class="para1">As I became increasingly fascinated with photography, a burning passion became to increase inside of me. The need to take photographs was captivating; not only was it for a grade, but an escape I used to drown my feelings. Photography was now becoming a way of expressing myself. Excitement rushed through my veins as the teacher would announce my name for the best photo of the week; an unforgettable feeling that would fulfill my ambition and made me feel virtuoso. After the end of the first semester, I began to feel as if a transformation begun inside of me. A transformation that began as a passion and turned into an obsession. Everywhere I saw I could see all the plain and ordinary things or objects of everyday life, but suddenly they became a whole new world; a spellbinding sensation that would make me fathom the double meaning of life. For example, hands are not much of importance to a person with no artistic view, but a photographer may view hands as aging, a sign of unity, caring, loving, or cry for help.
